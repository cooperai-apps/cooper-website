## 01. These Terms May Change

We may update and amend these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion, including by adding, deleting or modifying terms. If the changes to these Terms materially modify your rights or obligations, they will be effective on the earlier of the date upon which you consent to them or thirty (30) days from the date on which we notify you of the updates. If the changes do not materially modify your rights or obligations, they will be effective when posted on any part of the Site, and your continued use of the Site after the posting of any changes to these Terms will mean that you accept and agree to the changes. Every time you wish to use the Site, please check these Terms to ensure you understand the terms that apply to you at that time.

## 02. Customer Accounts

In order to access or use any of our Services, you may be required to log in and create an account either as a user or on behalf of your company as the Customer ("**Account**"). As part of the Account registration process, you may be asked to provide information such as your name, email address, job role, as well as select a username and password.

Cooper AI may refuse to grant you a username for any reason at our sole discretion, including if Cooper AI determines that such username impersonates someone else, is illegal, vulgar, or otherwise offensive, or is protected by trademark or other proprietary rights law, or otherwise may cause confusion.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of the login credentials for your Account. Your Account may include personal and sensitive information, including payment information, and you should treat your login credentials, such as your name, username or password as confidential. You may not allow others to use your Account (except for Authorized Users as defined in the MSA, if applicable); which includes furnishing your username and password to third-party developed applications to connect to your Account, unless authorized by the applicable MSA or by Cooper AI. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, including any activity by unauthorized users. If you become aware of unauthorized access to your Account, change your password and notify us immediately support@askcooper.ai.

You certify that the information you provide to us at any point, including in connection with the registration process of your Account or with the use of the Site, is true, accurate, current, and complete. You agree that you will maintain and update such information regularly.

## 04. Communication

If you opt into marketing calls and text messages, you agree to receive phone calls and text messages from us, and from our affiliates, agents, representatives, assigns, successors, and service providers (collectively, the "**Messaging Parties**"), for marketing purposes related to Cooper AI's products and services. Consent is not a condition of any purchase. You understand that Cooper AI and the Messaging Parties may also contact you via calls and text messages for transactional reasons (e.g. account communications/invoicing).

You authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to Cooper AI or its service provider for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help your carrier to identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. For questions about your privacy, please review our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

You can unsubscribe from promotional email communications at any time. To stop receiving our promotional emails, follow the unsubscribe instructions in the email messages you receive from us. We will process your request as soon as practicable after receipt, in accordance with applicable laws.

## 05. Failure to Comply with Terms; Termination

These Terms will continue to apply even if you are suspended or terminated.

### 6.4. Governing Law; Venue

These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of, or related to, them or the Site will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

### 6.5. Assignment

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Cooper AI without restriction.

### 6.6. Miscellaneous

Cooper AI's failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. These Terms are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter, except that, as indicated above, in the event of a conflict between these Terms and the terms governing your use of the Services, the terms governing your use of the Services will prevail.
