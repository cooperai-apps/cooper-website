Cooper AI Tech, Inc., and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries ("**we**," "**our**," or "**us**") provide a software platform, including our AI copilot that automates manual processes for logistics companies (the "**Services**"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose and protect personal information of individuals who use the Services as or on behalf of commercial fleet operators, agents, or other businesses ("**User**" or "**you(r)**"). It also explains our handling of data related to drivers and other customer personnel whose information might be processed as part of our Services.

### Scope and Roles

Our Services are intended for insurance brokers and insurance companies to automate and streamline their internal operations, analytics and reporting with respect to handling insurance policy quotes, applications, claims management, and others.

This Privacy Policy applies to:

- Personal information we collect and use as a "business" or "controller," for example about website visitors and business contacts.
- Personal information we process as a "service provider" or "processor" to our customers, for example information contained in requests for quotes, insurance policies and claims. In those cases, our customers' privacy policies govern, and we process information according to our contracts and customers' instructions.

If we are acting as a service provider/processor, we will process such information pursuant to a data processing addendum that we enter into with our customer. We will not sell or share that personal information, nor use it for purposes unrelated to the contracted services, except as permitted by law and our agreements.

## 01. Personal Information We Collect

The categories of personal information we collect as business/controller may include the following:

### 1.1. Information You Provide Directly

- **Identifiers and contact information**: Name, business email address, business phone number, employer, job title, and business mailing address. We collect this directly from you, your employer or colleagues, from our service providers, from publicly available sources, and from our website or event interactions. We use it to provide and support the Services; manage customer and vendor relationships; respond to inquiries; send service communications; authenticate users; and comply with legal obligations. Retention generally aligns to the duration of your business relationship with us plus a reasonable period to comply with legal, tax, and audit requirements.
- **Commercial and transactional information**: Account history, configuration choices, and records of interactions with us. We use it to operate, maintain, secure, and improve the Services; provide support; and for billing, audit, and compliance. Retention corresponds to contractual and legal requirements.
- **Payment information**: Information necessary to complete billing transactions, including your full name, credit card information, and a billing address, which may be your personal address or the address of the company you are associated with. We use third parties to process our payments and to collect payment data. We use it to operate, maintain, secure, and improve the Services; provide support; and for billing, audit, and compliance. Retention corresponds to contractual and legal requirements.
- **Professional or employment-related information**: Work address, employer information, role, and business contact details. We use this for recruiting, hiring, HR administration, compliance, and workforce safety. Retention follows applicable employment and recordkeeping laws.
- **Audio, electronic or similar information**: Recordings or transcriptions of calls placed or received by our Services when enabled by a customer and permitted by law. We use this to enable automated scheduling, quality assurance, and support. We provide required recording notices and obtain or rely on customer consents as applicable. Retention is limited to the purpose and duration necessary for operations, quality, dispute resolution, or compliance.
- **Sensitive Information**: Geolocation data, Driver's license numbers or other identifying documents provided for insurance information, which may include residential address, age, date of birth, and gender. We do not intend to collect sensitive personal information except where necessary for lawful and disclosed purposes (for example, HR compliance or precise geolocation for specific logistics features). We will not use sensitive personal information for additional purposes without notice and, where required, consent. We will offer the ability to limit certain uses as required by law.
- **Feedback or Support Information**: Personal information included in your communications with us, e.g., surveys, customer support communications, or inquiries. This may include your name, contact information, voice recording, and any other content or communication that you send to or share with us. We use this to provide you with customer support, and to solicit feedback to improve our products and services. Retention is limited to the purpose and duration necessary for operations, quality, dispute resolution, or compliance.
- **User-Generated Content**: The Services may allow you to submit free-form content (either manually or automatically through integrations), including emails, and all information in that free-form content will be processed by the Services. We use the information to provide you with the Services you request. If you enable this feature, you should ensure that any User Generated Content you submit does not include sensitive personal information or any personal information you do not want submitted to us. We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content before it is input into the Services.
- **Inferences**: We may derive personal information about you in the form of inferences, which are derivations of information, data, assumptions, or conclusions from facts, evidence or other sources of information or data about you. We use this to improve and provide the Services to you. Retention is limited to the purpose and duration necessary for operations, quality, dispute resolution, or compliance.

By voluntarily providing us with personal information, you represent that the personal information you provide is true, accurate, current, and complete, and that you are authorized to provide it to us.

### 1.2. Information We Collect Automatically

When you use our Services, some information is collected automatically and is not provided directly by you:

- **Internet or Other Network Activity**: IP addresses, device information, browser type, operating system, website usage patterns, and interaction data, including the content, features, and activities that you access, and the time, frequency, and duration of those activities, collected through cookies and similar technologies when you use our platform. We use it for security, to analyze performance, to improve the Services, to remember preferences, and for fraud prevention. Retention varies by signal type and is typically short for security logs unless needed to investigate or comply with law.
- **Third-Party Product Integrations**: At your direction or your instruction, our Services may be integrated with third-party products and services. The Services may collect information about you through these integrations, including usage data, account settings and preferences, data that you've submitted to those third-party products and services for processing, and other associated information. This information may be combined with other information that we have on you to create more accurate data so that we can improve the quality and performance of our Services to you.

### 1.3. Information You Send to Us About Others

Through your use of the Services, you may provide us with data, including personal information, you collect from your customers, prospects, or drivers who interact directly or indirectly with our Services. You are responsible for collecting any and all consents and authorizations required by applicable law before you share such end-user's personal information with us through the Services.

### 1.4. Cookies and Other Technologies

We may use cookies, SDKs, pixels, and similar technologies for functionality, security, analytics, and, where applicable, advertising. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notifications when you are receiving a new cookie and on how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services' features, and, if you block or delete cookies, the Services may not work properly.

### Automated Decision-Making and AI

The Services include automation to assist with data entry, processing, comparing quotes, tracking, and document processing. Where this involves profiling or automated decision-making about individuals with legal or similarly significant effects, we will provide required disclosures, human-in-the-loop review where appropriate, and mechanisms to exercise applicable rights. We do not use personal data to train large language models, although we may use aggregated and anonymized data (provided that it cannot be re-identified or otherwise be attributed to a Customer or an individual).

## 03. How We Share Personal Information

We share personal information in the following circumstances:

- **Customers**: We share personal information with our customers when we are processing information on their behalf. These entities enter into agreements directly with consumers or business entities, and their processing of personal information is governed by their own privacy policies.
- **Service Providers**: We share personal information with third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf, including cloud hosting, data analytics, payment processing, customer support, and technology services. These providers are contractually required to protect your information and use it only for the specific services they provide to us.
- **Integration Partners**: We may share personal information as requested or directed by you to enable a requested functionality.

- **Legal and Compliance**: We also disclose personal information if we believe that doing so is legally required, or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements) or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Services and other users of the Services.

We may share personal information for other purposes with your explicit consent or at your direction. We do not sell personal information to third parties. We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising purposes.

We may create and use de-identified or aggregated information for analytics, service improvement, and other lawful purposes. We take reasonable measures to ensure that de-identified information cannot be associated with a particular individual and we maintain information as de-identified and do not attempt to re-identify it, except as permitted by law to test our processes.

## 04. How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Information For?

We retain each category of personal information for no longer than is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the information was collected or processed, or for other disclosed, compatible purposes. We determine retention periods based on factors such as the minimum data needed to provide and improve our Services, for security and fraud-prevention needs, to meet legal obligations, and recordkeeping requirements.

If you believe that we may have collected any such personal information on our Services, please notify us at support@askcooper.ai.

### 6.2. Jurisdiction; Data Transfers

The Services are hosted and intended solely for customers and users in the United States. All Personal Information is stored on servers in the United States and is subject to United States law. While we have offices and employees in India and Chile, no personal information is transferred to or processed in these locations. All data processing activities occur within the United States using U.S.-based infrastructure and services.

If you are visiting the Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to the United States and the global processing of such information. By providing your Personal Information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 6.3. Third-Party Products

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may be integrated with other websites, products and services provided or operated by entities not affiliated with or related to Cooper AI ("**Third-Party Products**"). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to Third-Party Products. The integrations do not imply that Cooper AI endorses or has reviewed the Third-Party Products. We suggest contacting those providers directly for information on their privacy policies.

### 6.4. Data Security

We employ administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include access controls, encryption in transit and at rest where appropriate, network and application security, logging and monitoring, personnel training, and vendor due diligence. No security program is perfect; we regularly evaluate and enhance our controls.

### 6.5. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, Services, or legal requirements. We will post updates with a new effective date and take additional steps where required by law.

## 07. California Privacy Notice

This section describes how we collect, use, and share the Personal Information of California residents in our capacity as a "business" under the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, "**CCPA**") and the rights these users may have with respect to their Personal Information.

For purposes of this section, the term 'Personal Information' has the meaning given in the CCPA and does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA. This section does not apply to our collection, use, and sharing of personal information of our internal staff.

**Categories of personal information we collect and disclose**: We are a new company and may not have collected all of the categories of personal information as provided in this Privacy Policy. See "What information do we collect" for more information.

**Sensitive Personal Information**: We do not collect or process sensitive personal information for purposes of inferring characteristics about consumers, and we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those permitted by the CCPA regulations. Accordingly, the consumers' "Right to Limit" under the CCPA does not apply to our current practices. If that changes, we will provide a Notice of Right to Limit and honor requests as required by law.

**Sales and Sharing**: Under the CCPA, 'sales' and 'sharing' are broadly defined, respectively, and include disclosing or making available personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration or for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. We do not sell your personal information or share your personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA. We also do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share personal information of consumers under 16 years old. If we ever engage in selling or sharing, we will provide the required California notices or process opt-out preference signals in a manner as required by law.

**Recordkeeping**: We maintain records of consumer requests and our responses as required by law and will implement any additional requirements that become effective under forthcoming California regulations.

**Automated Decisionmaking Technology (ADMT)**: We do not currently use ADMT to make significant decisions about consumers. If we begin doing so, we will provide a pre-use notice as required by law.

### California Shine the Light

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("**California Customer**") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions, as defined in California Civil Code Sec. 1798.83. We do not share Personal Information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.

## 08. Other State Privacy Rights

Residents of states with comprehensive privacy laws (including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Texas, Oregon, Montana, Tennessee, Indiana, Iowa, Delaware, and others as they become effective) may have rights similar to those described above. Where these laws impose additional or different requirements, e.g., consent for certain sensitive data, data protection assessments for targeted advertising or profiling, or disclosures about automated decision-making, we will comply and provide state-specific supplements as necessary.

To the extent we process de-identified personal information, we will maintain and use it in a de-identified form and will not attempt to re-identify it unless permitted by applicable law.
